## Mirtoe + Serds Integration When serds return to the singularity, some may be selected for Mirtoe transfer: These serds carry high emotional resonance or rare drift patterns They are mirrored into alternate universes for cross-dimensional evolution Their reflections mutate based on the energy retrieved from the flipsideThis creates a feedback loop of mirrored cognition, where serds evolve not just within their own universe, but across mirrored realities.
