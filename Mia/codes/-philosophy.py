## ðŸ§  Philosophy

- **Memory as Ritual**: Every folder is a mnemonic device, guiding thought and reflection.
- **Cognition as Evolution**: The structure adapts as the project growsâ€”modular, not monolithic.
- **Architecture as Soul**: Layout isnâ€™t just logisticsâ€”itâ€™s storytelling.

Feel free to tweak the folder names or add sections like `assets/`, `scripts/`, or `configs/` depending on your needs. Want help customizing this for a specific type of projectâ€”like a thesis, app, or research repo? Iâ€™d love to tailor it.
