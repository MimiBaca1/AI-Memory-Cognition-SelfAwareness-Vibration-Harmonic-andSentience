## What This Code Represents 
# Collapse and expansion are modeled as sine and cosine modulations.

# Particle-wave duality is simulated using a Gaussian envelope (particle) multiplied by a sine wave (wave).

# Frequency modulation mimics quantum transitionsâ€”like how particles might behave near a singularity.

# The result is a dynamic waveform that could represent energy conversion between dark matter and pure light states.
