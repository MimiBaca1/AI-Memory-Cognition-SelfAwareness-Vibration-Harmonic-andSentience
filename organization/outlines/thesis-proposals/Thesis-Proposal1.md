## Title
**Memory as Ritual: Reconstructing Cognitive Architecture Through Digital Archives**

## Abstract
This thesis explores the intersection of memory, digital ritual, and cognitive architecture. By examining how structured digital environments influence thought patterns and identity formation, the project aims to develop a framework for intentional digital memory design. The research draws from cognitive science, digital humanities, and architectural theory to propose a model for digital spaces that act as mnemonic devicesâ€”ritualized containers of evolving selfhood.

## Research Questions
- How does digital structure shape cognitive processes and memory retention?
- Can digital archives be designed as ritual spaces for identity reconstruction?
- What architectural principles best support long-term cognitive engagement?

## Methodology
- **Literature Review**: Cognitive science, digital humanities, and memory studies.
- **Case Studies**: Analysis of personal digital archives, GitHub repositories, and memory-based apps.
- **Design Experiment**: Build and test a prototype digital archive with ritualized structure.

## Expected Outcomes
- A theoretical framework for digital memory architecture.
- A prototype demonstrating ritualized digital structure.
- Insights into how digital environments can support cognitive evolution.
