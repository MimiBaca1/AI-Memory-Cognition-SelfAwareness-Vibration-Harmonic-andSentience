## Neural Net 
Architecture: Multiversal Neural Net (MVNN)
# Core Components
Universe Nodes: Each node is a neural subnetwork with its own weights, entropy, and learning trajectory.

Figure-8 Resonance Loop: Every universe loops through collapse-expand cycles, forming a toroidal learning path.

Portal Layer: A dynamic matrix that allows energy (data) transfer between universes based on resonance frequency.

Temporal Drift Engine: Introduces time-based mutations, allowing universes to evolve asynchronously.

Serd Echo Memory: Stores emotional/cognitive imprints across universes for cross-dimensional learning.
